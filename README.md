# Deep_learning_-_Detecting_coloured_blocks
Code that generates a model for detecting coloured blocks, for the MBZIRC 2020 competition.

The files uploaded on github are two pretrained weights, two scripts for preprocessing of data, and lastly the code for generating the model.

The files on the following link is needed in order to run the preprocessing files, since it contains the dataset.

All the code can be run in the following order if you want to test it yourself.

1. Download and unzip the file in the link.
2. Run preprocess_data_blocks.ipynb (Takes a very long time)
3. Run preprocess_data_empty.ipynb
4. Run detecting_coloured_blocks_main.ipynb

However, as all the data is included in the zip file, all the code can be run independently, and step 2 and 3 can be skipped as only step 4 is relevant for the results.
